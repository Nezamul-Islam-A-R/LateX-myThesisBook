This is my whole thesis book written in latex. All credit goes to @Minhujul Haque vai 10 series.
I could not do this without his templet.
We had an updated from previous template thats why I have included some new packages and modify some
required portion.
If any one want to use this as a template clone this into your desktop then at first run 
this in your machine with textmaker/textstudio or any latex editor.
I used textstudio. If any one want to recommend for him one editor I will say textstudio is better option to choose.
Remember, when you try to run this code for the first time in your machine try to put Internet connection in on state so that the 
required packages will inatall autometically.
