\noindent Recommendation system is an information filtering system based on users different attributes and used in online e-commerce applications to improve user engagement and then to increase revenue. The main challenge for a recommender systems is providing quality recommendation to the users in cold-start situation. Collaborative filtering and Content-based filtering are two approaches. We consider one “cold-start” problem from three types Recommendation on existing items for new users, Recommendation on new items for existing users \& Recommendation on new items for new users, which is "Recommendation on existing items for new users". In this paper, we build a movie rating prediction based on K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Decision Tree (DT) approach with using K-means clustering algorithm for “cold-start” situation in a system. Then compare these two method based on the MAE \& RMSE value in different number of cluster to evaluate better method in “cold-start” situation.
